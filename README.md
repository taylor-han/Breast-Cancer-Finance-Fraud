# Applications of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms in Finance and Health Science
 Supervised machine learning algorithms have been
acknowledged for demonstrating their strengths in predicting
outputs given original inputs. This project attempts to reproduce
the results found by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil in their
study. The datasets considered in this project pertain to the
fields of finance and health science, two of many fields that
their success improves our daily life.
